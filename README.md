s conversions working (w/o extensive testing)

c conversions working (w/o extensive testing)


Currently working on d and i conversions (precision working, no flags or width yet)


TO DO:

-make a Makefile.

-separate functions into individual files (aka ORGANIZE).

-run norminette.

-work on conversions u, x, X and p.

-run actual tests instead of just my crappy main file.

The projects a mess ðŸ¥³
